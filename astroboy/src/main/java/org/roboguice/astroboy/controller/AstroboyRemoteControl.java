/**
 * A class to control Astroboy remotely.
 *
 * This class uses the current context, so we must make it @ContextSingleton.
 * This means that there will be one AstroboyRemoteControl for every activity or
 * service that requires one.
 * Note that we actually ask for the Activity, rather than the Context (which is
 * the same thing), because we need access to some activity-related methods and this
 * saves us from having to downcast to an Activity manually.
 *
 * It also asks RoboGuice to inject the Astroboy instance so we can control him.
 *
 * What you'll learn in this class
 *   - What @ContextSingleton means and when to use it
 *   - How to inject an Activity instead of a Context (which is really the same thing)
 *   - How to use RoboGuice's convenient and flexible logging facility, Ln.
