How to build the source
-----------------------

We use Apache Maven and the Android Maven Plugin to build roboguice and the sample application.

- Install Apache Maven from http://maven.apache.org/

- Install the Android SDK including all platform versions and all extras

- Install the Android artifacts from the SDK in the Maven repository using the  Maven Android SDK Deployer
  https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer

  This is due maps.jar and the compatibility library not being available in any public repo.

- Run
  mvn clean install
  to build roboguice and the sample astroboy.

- Deploy astroboy on a connected device/emulator with
  cd astroboy
  mvn android:deploy
  and run it with
  mvn android:run
