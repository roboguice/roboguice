/**
 * An object capable of providing objects of type {@code TO}, using extras of
 * type {@code FROM}.<br />
 * <br />
 * Converters enable you to convert Android Extras to complex objects. For
 * instance, sending a long timestamp as an extra, and getting a Date injected.<br />
 * <br />
 * Once you have created an {@link ExtraConverter} implementation, you should
 * bind it in your module configuration. Usage example: {@code bind(new
 * TypeLiteral<ExtraConverter<Long, Date>>() ).to(DateExtraConverter.class);}<br />
 * <br />
 * Usage in your components is as simple as : {@code
 * \@InjectExtra("timestampExtra") protected Date date; } <br />
 * <br />
 * You will usually want your converters to be singletons, so you should
 * annotate them with {@link Singleton}.<br />
 * <br />
 * Please notice that the context in which the bean that gets the extra injected
 * is scoped should implements {@link InjectorProvider} to get the convert
 * mechanism to work. This is because the {@link ExtrasMembersInjector} need an
 * {@link Injector} to get an {@link ExtraConverter} instance.
 * 
 * @param <FROM>
